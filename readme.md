# Magic Trick
##### My Project Submission of the Udacity Course *ARKit with Swift*

### xCode Version used: 9.1

### Instructions on how to use the app
* after starting this app, move your phone to find a surface that can be used by ARKit
* when a plane is detected, it will be visualized as a gray area - tap on it, to place there a magic hat!
* after that, push the *toss*-Button, to throw a ball! Try to throw it inside the magic hat!
* when you tap on the magic hat, the magic trick will be performed and all the balls in it will disappear!
